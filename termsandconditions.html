			<p>End User License Agreement</p>

			<p>Welcome to the Dalí Museum Staring Contest Application (the “Application”), owned and operated by The Dalí Museum (“The Dalí Museum,” “we,” “us” or “our”).  We maintain and make available the Application for your personal, non-commercial use only. By accessing and using the Application, you acknowledge and agree to abide by the terms of this End User License Agreement (the “Agreement”), the terms of service of any applicable platform provider, including but not limited to Apple, Facebook and/or Twitter (each, a “Platform Provider”), as well as all applicable laws, rules and regulations.  If you do not agree to the terms of the Agreement, you may not use the Application.  The Agreement is subject to change by us at any time, effective when posted on and/or within the Application.  Your continued use of the Application after such notice will constitute acceptance by you of such changes.</p>

			<p>Overview.  After downloading the Application to your Apple iOS product(s) (iPhone® 5, iPhone® 5S), you can select to play the Staring Contest game (the “Game”) within the Application, which will involve staring at certain images provided within the Game as well as photographs of other Application users while your eyes are monitored to determine if and when you blink.  If you achieve a high score by staring the longest within the Game, your photograph, as captured during the Game, will be shared within the Application as part of a High Score Board and displayed to other Application users playing the Game, and your photograph may also appear on The Dalí Museum’s website, http://theDalí.org/home.php. You will have the opportunity to share your Game scores via certain social media, including via Twitter, and in Apple’s Game Center.</p>
